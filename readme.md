# difference between var, let, and const  :
#### var: 
old way,has some weird rules like:doesn’t care much about scope ;re-declare the same variable many times.

modern way,respects scope,change the value

#### const: 
constant,respects scope,Best for things that should never change.

#### filter() 
runs test on each item and returns new array only the items that passed.
